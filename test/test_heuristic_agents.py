# Test heuristic agents for LB-Foraging.
# Each agent has a parameter that specifies the radius of its sight
#     H1 always goes to the closest visible food.
#     H2 goes to the one visible food which is closest to the center of all visible players.
#     H3 always goes to the closest visible food with compatible level (i.e. it can load it).
#     H4 goes to the one visible food which is closest to all visible players such that the sum of their and H4's level is sufficient to load the food.
# H1-4 try to load the food once they are next to it. If they do not see a food, they go into a random direction.
